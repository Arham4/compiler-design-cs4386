# CS 4386 - Project 1: Terminal Token Identifier

This codebase uses Cup and JFlex to generate a scanner that follows rules for terminals that are given.

## Instructions

1. Find the Makefile that corresponds to your system. Solaris will use the Makefile-linux file.
2. Rename the Makefile to just say `Makefile`.
3. Open the terminal to the current directory.
4. Type `make`. This will run the `make all` command, which will generate the required classes, compile it to the `out/production/project-1` directory, then run program.
5. To change the test file, open the Makefile and change the `TEST_FILE` constant to be the respective test.
6. To change the input directory, open the Makefile and change the `TEST_FILES_DIR` constant to be the respective directory.
7. To change the output directory, open the Makefile and change the `OUTPUT_FILES_DIR` constant to be the respective directory.
